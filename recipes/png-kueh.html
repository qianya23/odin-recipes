    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the glutinous rice for at least one hour and peanut for at least 2 hours. If you want to have softer texture, it is best to soak overnight. While buying peanuts from the shops, you can also enquired if there is any type that can cook faster .</li>
            <li>Steam the glutinous rice and peanut under high heat for at least 1/2 hour. Sprinkle water occasionally and steam until soft.  Alternatively, you can cook the peanut and glutinous rice in a rice cooker if the rice cooker have a sticky rice/glutinous rice function. For rice cooker function, you need to add the 170ml of water.</li>
            <li>In a wok, put the oil and sauté the sliced shallots until aromatic and almost brown. Add in the sliced mushrooms, dried shrimps and white pepper. Stir fry for 1-2 minutes until the dried shrimps are aromatic. Add the glutinous rice and peanut, followed by chicken stock and fish sauce. Stir fry until well mixed. Off the heat and add the chopped spring onion . Stir until well mixed. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mixed all the flours (glutinous rice flour and rice flour) and divided into two bowls of equal portion.</li>
            <li>In a pot, put the water followed by peach red colouring. Bring the water to boil. Once it boils, turn to lowest heat, add one portion of mixed flour, use something (rolling pin) to stir until it form a paste. Cooked for 1 minute under lowest heat and off the heat.</li>
            <li>While the cooked dough is still hot, quickly transfer the cooked dough to a mixing bowl. GRADUALLY ADD THE REMAINING FLOUR and knead the dough until it forms a pliable dough. If you can’t take the heat, you can use a spatula or a stand mixer to do the job initially. Add in the cooking oil or lard and knead until it become a smooth dough</li>
            <li>Pat your hand with flour, pinch a dough, shape round, press it and make it flat. Put a teaspoon of the fillings into the centre of flat dough. Seal the edges such that it looks like a samosa triangular shaped dough.  Press down the dough follow the shape of the mould.</li>
            <li>Knock the mould to get the dough out and put in a steamer tray. For steamer tray, see the notes below.</li>
            <li>Bring the steamer to boil. Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium. Steam  the rice cake for about 13-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Best served with some chilli sambal or sweet soya sauce. It will turn hard rather easily if you left it overnight, therefore, store in an airtight container is important once it cooled down.  It is  also common that the rice cake be pan fried on the next day to get a crispy outer skin.</li>
