    <p>The good, old Ang Ku Kueh that reminds you of your grandparents.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>150 g split mung beans</li>
            <li>160 g water</li>
            <li>1 pandan leaf</li>
            <li>70g sugar</li>
            <li>a pinch of salt</li>
            <li>45g vegetable oil</li>
            <li>120g sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>130g glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>banana leaves</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse mung beans under running water. In a bowl, cover the mung beans with water and soak for at least 5 hours or overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Discard the water used to soak mung beans. Pour in more water and add knotted pandan leaf. Steam for 25-30 minutes over medium heat. They will be soft when ready. Blend steamed mung beans until they turned into a paste.</li>
            <li>In a pan over low heat, cook the blended mung bean paste with sugar, salt and oil. Keep stirring the ingredients for 5 minutes or until the paste is no longer sticking to the pan. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Steam skinned sweet potatoes until soft and mash finely. Mix in sugar, oil, glutinous rice flour and lastly, boiling water. Use a spatula to mix the ingredients and once it is no longer too hot, knead it with your hands. You may add one or two drops of food colouring (optional).</li>
            <li>Divide the filling and dough separately into rounds of 25g each. You may need more if the mould you use is larger. Flatten one portion of the dough and wrap the filling. Then, press it into the mould. Repeat until all are shaped.</li>
            <li>Cut banana leaf into pieces larger than the shaped kueh. Brush some oil on the smoother side of the banana leaf. Place the shaped kueh onto the banana leaf and steam for 10-12 minutes over medium heat. Read tips above on steaming.</li>
        </ol>
